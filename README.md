## :scroll: Description
ColonyX Weather provides a weather data for a remote Mars colony named ColonyX. The application provides current
weather conditions for the current day and time as well for other statistical data for previous sols

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
With this app I decided to fantasize for a bit about the weather app for the users of the future,
which might get a new home planet some day :). The data used by the app is based on the [data gathered by Curiosity Rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/weather/)
